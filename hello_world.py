# You will use this file to write your first Python program and make your first commits and submits to GitHub.
# You are going to write a program that will print the words, "Hello, world!" onto the screen. 
# To do this, you are going to use a special print() function built into Python. 
# First, edit the comment on Line 5 below with your FIRST NAME and LAST INITIAL. Remove the < > characters on the line.
# <First Name> <Last Initial>
# Make your first commit and submit.  The teacher will demonstrate this process.  Please pay attention!  
# At the start of Line 9 below, type print()
# This line of code tells Python to print on the screen.  Now we need to tell it what to print.
# Inside the () on Line 9, type "Hello, world!"  Make sure to include the quotation marks.  

# Run your program.  Did your string print correctly on the screen? 
# DELETE THIS LINE COMPLETELY FROM YOUR CODE.  
# If yes, commit and submit your code as version 1.0. 
# If no, debug and try again.  Ask for help if necessary.
